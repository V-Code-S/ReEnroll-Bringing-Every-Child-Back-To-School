# **ReEnroll: Bringing Every Child Back to School**

### **Overview**
**ReEnroll** is a mission-driven initiative designed to tackle the issue of school dropouts, particularly in rural areas of India. The platform empowers communities to report dropout cases, collaborates with NGOs and government authorities to provide interventions, and ensures the re-enrollment of children into educational institutions.

With the support of seed funding from the **Aspire Institute**, Harvard, ReEnroll aims to address systemic barriers to education, including child labor, early marriage, and socio-economic challenges, by leveraging technology and community-driven solutions.
